# OneOne

A simple tool to manage 1-on-1 meetings.

## What It Does

Track who you meet with, what you discussed, and when you want to meet again.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development** - Currently defining requirements and experimenting with Rust implementation.

See [PRODUCT_SPEC.md](PRODUCT_SPEC.md) for MVP requirements.
See [EXPERIMENT.md](EXPERIMENT.md) for details about our Rust "vibe coding" approach.

## MVP Goals

1. Track people + notes about them
2. Log meetings + discussion points
3. See when you last met with someone
4. Plan next meetings with a "need to schedule" view
