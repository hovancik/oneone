# Rust Vibe Coding Experiment

## Experiment Overview

**Goal**: Test whether Rust can be effective for "vibe coding" - building software based on intuition and natural problem-solving flow rather than deep language expertise.

## Experiment Setup

**Participant**: Developer with Ruby/Node.js experience (dynamic, expressive languages)
**AI Role**: Handle all Rust syntax, compilation, and language-specific details
**Focus**: Problem-solving flow and natural expression of ideas in Rust

## What We're Testing

1. **Natural Problem Modeling**: Can Rust's type system intuitively represent real-world concepts?
2. **Creative Flow**: Does Rust help or hinder the natural problem-solving process?
3. **Learning Curve**: How much Rust knowledge is needed for productive development?
4. **Compiler Guidance**: Does Rust's error system guide toward good solutions?
5. **Code Feel**: Does the resulting code "feel right" to someone from dynamic languages?

## The Problem

Building a tool to manage 1-on-1 meetings with teammates and managers:
- Track meeting notes and context about people
- Smart reminders for when to schedule follow-ups  
- Handle different meeting cadences (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.)
- Provide context from previous meetings when preparing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can express the problem naturally without getting stuck on Rust syntax
- [ ] Solutions feel intuitive and maintainable
- [ ] Development flow stays focused on problem-solving vs. fighting the language
- [ ] Final tool is actually useful and pleasant to use

## Process

1. **Problem Discussion**: User describes what they want in natural terms
2. **Solution Design**: Collaborative discussion of approach and data modeling  
3. **Implementation**: AI translates ideas into Rust, explaining key decisions
4. **Iteration**: Refine based on "feel" and usability feedback
5. **Reflection**: Assess how Rust helped or hindered the process

## Notes

- User does not write code directly
- Focus on expressing intent and evaluating results
- AI handles all Rust-specific details and explains decisions when relevant
- **AI must always check if tasks can be automated with available tools before asking for manual steps**
- AI takes full ownership of technical infrastructure and setup
- Minimize user friction by automating everything possible
