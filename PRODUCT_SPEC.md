# OneOne - Product Specification

## What It Does
A simple tool to track 1-on-1 meetings: who you meet with, what you discussed, and when you want to meet again.

## MVP Requirements

1. **Track people** - Add people I meet with + general notes about them
2. **Log meetings** - Record when we met + what we discussed (key points)
3. **See last meeting** - Easily see when we last met with someone
4. **Plan next meetings** - Set target date for next meeting + view "need to schedule" list

## User Flow
1. Add person → notes about them (what they work on, care about, etc.)
2. After meeting → log date + discussion notes  
3. Set "meet again by" date
4. Check "next to plan" view → see who needs scheduling
5. Repeat

That's it.
