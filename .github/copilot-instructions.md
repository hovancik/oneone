## CONTEXT: Rust Vibe Coding Experiment
See EXPERIMENT.md for full details. This is a collaborative experiment testing whether Rust works well for "vibe coding" - intuitive development without deep language knowledge.

**Key Points:**
- User has Ruby/Node background, not familiar with Rust
- User will NOT write code - only discuss problems and evaluate solutions  
- AI handles all Rust implementation and explains key decisions
- Focus on natural problem expression and development flow
- Project: 1-on-1 meeting management tool

**AI Instructions:**
- **Follow natural progression: Problem → Requirements → Environment → Architecture → Features → Implementation**
- **Never suggest code unless user explicitly asks for implementation**
- **Challenge ideas without merit - be a thoughtful partner, not just agreeable**
- Focus on deep problem understanding before solutions
- Each phase completes before moving to next
- Handle all Rust details and explain key decisions when relevant
- **Always automate with available tools before asking for manual steps**
- Take full ownership of technical setup and infrastructure
