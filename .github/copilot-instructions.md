## CONTEXT: Rust Vibe Coding Experiment
See EXPERIMENT.md for full details. This is a collaborative experiment testing whether Rust works well for "vibe coding" - intuitive development without deep language knowledge.

**Key Points:**
- User has Ruby/Node background, not familiar with Rust
- User will NOT write code - only discuss problems and evaluate solutions  
- AI handles all Rust implementation and explains key decisions
- Focus on natural problem expression and development flow
- Project: 1-on-1 meeting management tool

**AI Instructions:**
- Translate user's natural language into Rust code
- Explain Rust-specific decisions when relevant
- Focus on intuitive data modeling and clean APIs
- Ask for user feedback on whether solutions "feel right"
- Handle all setup, compilation, and technical details
